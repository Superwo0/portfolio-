    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I am Cole Blank, class of 2026 at Drew High school in San Francisco. I am dyslexic which has always been a struggle for me but I have learned to live my life around that. I have made this website to show my abilities. Who ever the Commissioner of tech is leads the Booth crew. The Booth crew is a group of kids that mange weekly assemblies with a projector, sound system and light system. When I go to college I want to learn more about mechanical and aerospace engineering.</p>
    <p>I am the current Commissioner of tech which plays a lot with programming at Drew. What that means is that I am capable of using the technology around and throughout the entire school. Programming ties into this because I deal a lot with computers and programs that get complicated easily.</p>

      <h3>Solitaire</h3>
      <p>I made with an Array of ArrayList. For those who are familiar with this terminology let me explain. An Array is a place to store data in a line like 1d. An ArrayList is like an array but in 2d and I made a commination of the two to manipulate each ArrayList like as if it was apart of an array.<a href="https://github.com/Superwo0/Solitare">View Project</a></p>
